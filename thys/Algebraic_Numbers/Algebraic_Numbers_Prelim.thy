section \<open>Algebraic Numbers -- Excluding Addition and Multiplication\<close>

text \<open>This theory contains basic definition and results on algebraic numbers, namely that
  algebraic numbers are closed under negation, inversion, $n$-th roots, and
  that every rational number is algebraic. For all of these closure properties, corresponding
  polynomial witnesses are available. 

  Moreover, this theory contains the uniqueness result,
  that for every algebraic number there is exactly one monic irreducible polynomial for it.
  This result is stronger than similar ones which you find in many textbooks.
  The reason is that here we do not require a least degree construction.

  This is essential, since given some monic irreducible polynomial for x,
  how should we check whether the degree is optimal. In the formalized result, this is
  no longer required. The result is proven via GCDs, and that the GCD does not change
  when executed on the rational numbers or on the reals or complex numbers.\<close>
