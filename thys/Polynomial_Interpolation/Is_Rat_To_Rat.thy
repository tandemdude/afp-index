section \<open>Conversions to Rational Numbers\<close>

text \<open>We define a class which provides tests whether a number is rational, and
  a conversion from to rational numbers. 
  These conversion functions are principle the inverse functions of \emph{of-rat}, but
  they can be implemented for individual types more efficiently.
  
  Similarly, we define tests and conversions between integer and rational numbers.\<close>
