  The permutation lists contain no duplicates if the inputs contain no duplicates.
  Therefore, these functions can easily be used when working with a representation of
  sets by distinct lists.
  The same approach should generalise to any kind of set implementation that supports
  a monadic bind operation, and since the results are disjoint, merging should be cheap.
